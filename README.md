# CSE 165 Final Project

## Game was made to run on MacOS

The application was made in [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/).
So I am unsure if the application will run properly in other IDE's.

This project was made following the tutorial made by [Learning OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com).

Dependencies:

- GLEW
- GLFW
- GLM
- [SOIL](https://github.com/kbranigan/Simple-OpenGL-Image-Library)
- ASSIMP
- Freetype

All dependencies (except SOIL) were installed using Homebrew for MacOS.

**_If you do not have Homebrew on your Mac system follow the instructions for installation
at the following:_** [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)

To install dependencies run the following commands in a new terminal:

`brew install assimp freetype glm glfw glew`
